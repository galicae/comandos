    "[SAMap](https://elifesciences.org/articles/66747) was the first method to try and include\n",

    "- In the publication, heatmaps are used once, but not to their full extent.\n",
    "- Overlapping dimplots with corresponding violin plots are used to demonstrate co-expression across\n",
    "  species. This is a good idea, but results in overloaded plots.\n",
    "- The authors use dotplots to show gene expression across species, color-coding the species. This\n",
    "  loses one of the dotplots' dimensions, where color usually encodes expression level, and forces\n",
    "  the use of an additional axis to show expression magnitude. Furthermore, the relationships between\n",
    "  the plotted genes in the different species are hard to visualize and need to be described in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "These visualisations have two additional shortcomings: First, they are not easily reproducible,\n",
    "as they are not part of SAMap but rather custom solutions for very specific use cases. Second, they\n",
